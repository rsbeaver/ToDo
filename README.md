This is the finished project (with some embellishments) from the Practical JavaScript --- PJS --- course authored by Gordon Zhu.

PJS uses a simple ToDo List project to introduce many of the basic and higher functions and methods of everyday JS.  This easy-to-understand course is the best that I have found. It takes JS learners--from beginners to experts--and explains the language step-by-step.  Made it easy to understand not only what was happening and required, but also WHY it was required. Actually made it possible to internalize this coding language.

If you are struggling with JS, or if you wish to increase your knowledge and skills, give this a try:
